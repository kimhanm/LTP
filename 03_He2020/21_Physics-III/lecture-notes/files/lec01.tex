\section{Optics}

Usually, we think of light as a wave. But often, we can simplify and just think of it as a ray. We can do it when the wavelength is much smaller than the size of the objects the light touches.\\

Going in the other direction, the more complete picture is electro-magnetic optics. We can go even further and look at light as a quantum phenomenon.\\

We will start out in the simplest model, Ray optics or also called Geometrical optics.


\subsection{Ray Optics}
\subsubsection{Fermat's Principle}
One of the underlying principles of Ray optics is \textbf{Fermat's principle}:\\
\emph{Light travels the path whose optical path length is extremal to variations in the path}
\\

Intuitively, this means that if we consider a path that is infinitesimally close the the actual path, the optical path lenth does not change.\\
The path is usually a minimum, but that is not always the case.
In a homogeneuous medium, where the speed of light is the same everywhere, this is just saying that light travels in a straight line.\\
Now consider two media, let's say vacuum and glass and Points $A$, $B$ in each medium\\
In vacuum, the speed of light is about $c = 3 \times 10^8 \m/\s$ and in glass, it is about $1.5$ times slower than that. We then can define the \textbf{refractive index} of glass to be the fraction 
\begin{align*}
				n_{\text{glass}} := \frac{c}{v_{\text{glass}}} \simeq 1.5
\end{align*}
This allows us to define the \textbf{optical path length} of a path to be the quantity
\begin{align*}
	D := n \cdot \ell
\end{align*}
, where $l$ is the physical length of the path.\\
If we can parametrize the space of variations from a path with a scalar quantity $\eta$ then \textbf{Fermat's Principle} can be reformulated to say 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d D(\eta)}{d\eta}|_{\eta = 0} = 0
\end{align*}
So what path does the light take if we take the situation depicted in figure \#\#?
We can easily calculate the total optical path length to be
\begin{align*}
	D = n_1 \sqrt{d_1^2 + h_1^2} + n_2 \sqrt{d_2^2 + h_2^2}
\end{align*}
Because $h, d_1, d_2$ are fixed and $h_2 = h - h_1$ we can write it using only the parameter $h_1$ so in order to find the extremum of $D(h_1)$ we need
\begin{align*}
	0 &= \frac{dD(h_1)}{dh_1}\\
	&= \frac{n_1 h_1}{\sqrt{d_1^2 + h_1^2}} - \frac{n_2h_2}{\sqrt{d_2^2 + (h-h_2)^2}}\\
	&= n_1 \sin \theta_1 - n_2 \sin \theta_2
\end{align*}
From this we get \textbf{Snell's Law:}

\begin{empheq}[box=\bluebase]{align*}
	n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2
\end{empheq}

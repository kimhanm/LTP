# Moving to Gitlab
After Github [was acquired by Microsoft](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-acquire-github-7-5-billion-stock-solidify-developer-ties/),
they announced a new feature for its platform called ["Copilot"](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsf-funded-call-for-white-papers-on-philosophical-and-legal-questions-around-copilot).
This technology is trained on publicly hosted code on github *including GPL* and other copyleft licensed software and attempts to launder copyleft software into proprietary garbage.

As a result, I will delete this repository in the near future and start hosting it over on GitLab.

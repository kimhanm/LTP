# Moving to Gitlab
All the source files are available over at my [Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/kimha/notes).

## Why
There are multiple reasons. The first was that my repository became bloated because I didn't set my `.gitignore` properly. As a result, this repo kept syncing binary `.pdf` files which made pulling and pushing much slower.

Another reason is because after Github [was acquired by Microsoft](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-acquire-github-7-5-billion-stock-solidify-developer-ties/),
they announced a new feature for its platform called ["Copilot"](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsf-funded-call-for-white-papers-on-philosophical-and-legal-questions-around-copilot).
This technology is trained on publicly hosted code on github *including GPL* and other copyleft licensed software and attempts to launder copyleft software into proprietary garbage.

As a result, I will delete this repository in the near future and start hosting it over on GitLab.

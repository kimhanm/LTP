Professor: Dr. Thomas Willwacher 

The lecture home page will be on \href{https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=14801}{moodle}.

Exercise lessons will start in the second week.

Solving the weekly exercises will be rewarded with up a $0.25$ bonus in the final grade if over $40\%$ of the exercises are reasonably done.

The main resource will be the MMP II script from G.Felder, with some additions to representation theory, lie algebras and tensors.

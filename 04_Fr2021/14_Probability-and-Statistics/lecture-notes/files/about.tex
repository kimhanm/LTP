\section*{About}

Lecture notes taken from the Wahrscheinlichkeit und Statistik lecture given by Dr. Josef Teichman during Spring Semester 2021 at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

\subsection*{Material}

There is a jupyter notebook which can be found at \href{https://gist.github.com/jteichma/a9c2621e0a27faf1b8a885c039120778}{Teichman's Github}.

The slides will be uploaded at the end of every week on his website which are accessed via the password sent per mail at the beginning of the semester.

A new scriptum will be published at the end of the semester. Until then, the old script can be used as they shouldn't differ too much.

\section{Continuous Models}
We now want to move from discrete probability spaces and consider \emph{continuous} ones, where the base space $\Omega$ is uncountable.

A generalisation of the defintion of a P-space is given as follows

\begin{dfn}[]
  A (continuous) P-space is a tuple $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\IP)$ if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\sigma$-Algebra.
    \item $\IP: \mathcal{A} \to [0,\infty]$ is $\sigma$-additive and normed ($\IP[\Omega] = 1$)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}
From measure theory, we know that we can extend $\mathcal{A}$ to the class of Lebesgue-measurable sets.

Although $\IP$ often cannot be extended to the complete powerset $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$, that is often not necessary.

Instead of starting with the probabilty measure $\IP$ and analyze random variables as we did in the previous section, 
we can also go the other way around and introduce random variables $X_i$ and look for a $\IP$ that satisfies some properties with respect to the $X_i$.

For this, let's first consider the $0-1$ experiments, where
\begin{align*}
  \Omega = \{0,1\}^{\N} = \{\omega = (x_1,x_2,\ldots): x_i \in \{0,1\}\}
\end{align*}
and set $X_i(\omega) =x_i$ be the $i$-th component of the outcome.
Then, let $\mathcal{A}$ be the $\sigma$-Algebra generated by sets of the form $\{\omega: X_i(\omega) = 1\}, i = 1,2,\ldots$.
\begin{thm}[]
  Given a parameter $p \in [0,1]$, there exists a unique probability measure $\IP_p$ on $\mathcal{A}$ such that
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\IP[X_i = 1] = p$ for all $i$
    \item The events $\{X_i = 1\}$ for all independent with respect to $\IP$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
It follows from the requirements on $\IP$ that for any choice of $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ we must have for $k = \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$
\begin{align*}
  \IP[X_1=x_1,\ldots,X_n=x_n] = \prod_{i=1}^{n}\IP[X_i=x_I]=p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k} 
\end{align*}
which automatically shows that $\IP$ is well defined on $\mathcal{A}$ and uniquely determins the events generated by finite union of the Form $\{X_1 = x_i, \ldots, X_n = x_n\}$.
By the Carath√©odory-Hahn theorem from measure theory, such an extension exsists and is unique.
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}[Borel-Cantelli]
Let $A_1,\ldots,A_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of events in $\mathcal{A}$. And let
\begin{align*}
  A_{\infty} = \limsup_{n \to \infty}A_n = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty}A_k
\end{align*}
be the set where infinitely many of the $A_k$ occur. Then
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\IP[A_k] < \infty$ implies $\IP[A_{\infty}] = 0$
  \item If the events $\left(A_{k}\right)_{k \in \N}$ are independent, then $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\IP[A_k] = \infty$ implies $\IP[A_{\infty}] = 1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Since the sequence $B_n = \bigcup_{k \geq n}A_k$ is decreasing, 
The proof follos from the subadditivity that
\begin{align*}
  \IP[A_{\infty}] = \lim_{n \to \infty}\IP[B_n] \leq \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{k \geq n}\IP[A_k] = 0
\end{align*}
On the other hand, if they are independent, then we can write
\begin{align*}
  \IP\left[\bigcap_{k \geq n}A_k^{c}\right]
  =
  \prod_{k\geq n}\IP[A_k^{c}]
  =
  \prod_{k\geq n}(1 - \IP[A_k])
\end{align*}
and since the exponential function is convex, $1 - x \leq e^{-x}$, so \begin{align*}
  \IP\left[
\bigcap_{k \geq n}A_k^{c}
  \right]
  \leq
  \exp \left(
    - \sum_{k \geq n} \IP[A_k]
  \right)
   = 0
\end{align*}
and since the sequence $\bigcap_{k \geq n}A_k^{c}$ is increasing in $n$ it follows that
\begin{align*}
  \IP[A_{\infty}^{c}] = \lim_{n \to \infty} \IP\left[\bigcap_{k \geq n}A_k^{c}\right]= 0
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

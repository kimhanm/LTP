Professor: Dr. Josef Teichman

\subsection*{Material}

there is a jupyter notebook which can be found at \href{https://gist.github.com/jteichma/a9c2621e0a27faf1b8a885c039120778}{Teichman's Github}.

The slides will be uploaded at the end of every week on his website which are accessed via the password \texttt{OLDScriptWuS}

A new scriptum will be published at the end of the semester. Until then, the old script can be used as they shouldn't differ too much.

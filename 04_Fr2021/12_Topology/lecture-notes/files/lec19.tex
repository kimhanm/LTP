\section{Axioms of Countability}
\subsection{First and second Countability axioms}

%If we consider 

As a motivating example consider a metric space $(X,d)$ and $x_0 \in X$, then every neighborhood of $x_0$ contains an open ball around $x_0$ and radius $\tfrac{1}{n}$ for $n \in \N$.
If $X = \R^{m}$, then the collection of open balls with rational centers
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{B} = \{B_{1/n}(v) \big\vert v\in \Q^{m}, n \in \N\}
\end{align*}
is a basis of the euclidean topology.



\begin{dfn}[]
  Let $(X,\tau) \in \Top$, $x_0 \in X$. Then the collection
  \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{U} \subseteq \{U \subseteq X \big\vert U \text{ is a neighborhood of }x_0\}
  \end{align*}
  is called a \textbf{neighborhood basis} of $x_0$, if every neighborhood of $x0$ contains a $U \in \mathcal{U}$.

  We say that $X$ fulfills the 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[1AA] \textbf{first countability axiom}, if every point has a countable neighborhood basis.
    \item[2AA] \textbf{second countability axiom}, if $X$ has a countable neighborhood basis.
  \end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

  The motivating example shows that every metric space fulfills the 1AA and in particular, $\R^{n}$ fulfills the 2AA.
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is also clear that if $X$ fulfills the 2AA, then it automatically fulfills the 1AA as we can just take all elements of $\mathcal{U}$ that contain $x_0$.
  \item If $Y \subseteq X$ is a subspace, then 
    \begin{align*}
      X \text{ fulfills } 1AA/2AA \implies Y \text{ fulfills the } 1AA/2AA
    \end{align*}
  \item If there exists an uncountable and discrete subset $A \subseteq X$, then $X$ cannot fulfill the 2AA.
    To see this let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis and choose a $U_a \subseteq X$ such that $U_a \cap A = \{a\}$. But then
    \begin{align*}
      \forall a \in A \exists O_a \in \mathcal{B} \text{ with } a \in O_a \subseteq U_a \implies A \hookrightarrow B, a \mapsto O_a \text{ is injective}
    \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\begin{ex}[]
  The space of continuous and bounded funcitons with the metric induced by the $\|\cdot\|_{\infty}$-Norm
  \begin{align*}
    C(\R) := \{\phi:  \R \to \R \big\vert \phi \text{ continuous, bounded}\}
  \end{align*}
  fulfills the 1AA but not the 2AA.
  To prove this, we construct such an uncoutable discrete subset $A$ as before. Take the set of $(0,1)$ sequences
  \begin{align*}
    \epsilon = \left(\epsilon_{n}\right)_{n \in \N}
  \end{align*}
  using this, we can chose a $\phi_{\epsilon}: \R \to \R$ that satisfies $\phi_{\epsilon}(n) = \epsilon_n$.
  then for all $n \in \N$ set
  \begin{align*}
    A = \{\phi_{\epsilon} \big\vert \epsilon \in \{0,1\}^{\N}\}
  \end{align*}
  then $B_1(a) \cap A = \{a\}$ for all $a \in A$ and as such, $A$ is discrete and uncountable.
\end{ex}



\subsection{Infinite products}
Let $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a family of metric sets and let $\pi_k, k \in I$ be the projection mappings with
\begin{align*}
  \pi_k: \prod_{i \in I}X_i \mapsto  X_k, \quad \{x_i\}_{i \in I} \mapsto  x_k
\end{align*}
If $I$ is finite, we use $n$-Tuple notation.


\begin{dfn}[]
Let $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a family of topological spaces.
The \textbf{product topology} on $\prod_{i \in I}X_i$ is defined as the unique topology which is generated by the basis of inverse images of open sets finitely many projection mappings.
  \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{B} = \{\pi_{i_1}^{-1}(U_1) \cap \ldots \cap \pi_{i_n}^{-1}(U_n) \big\vert n \in \N, i \in I, U_k \subseteq X_{i_k} \text{ open}\}
  \end{align*}
\end{dfn}
Equivalently, one can show that it is the coarsest topology on $\prod_{i \in I} X_i$ such that the projection mappings are continuous.

\begin{ex}[]
If we take $I = \{1,2,3\}$ and $X_i = \R$, then
\begin{align*}
  \prod_{i \in I}X_i = \R \times \R \times \R \supseteq U_1 \times U_2 \times U_3 = U_1 \times \R \times \R \cap \R \times U_2 \times \R \times \R \cap \R \times \R \times U_3
\end{align*} 
\end{ex}

The product topological space fulfills the following universal property, namely that of being the product in the Category $\Top$:

For any topological space $Y$ with continous maps $\{Y \stackrel{f_i}{\to}X_i\}_{i \in I}$ then there exists a unique continuous function $\phi: Y \to  \prod_{i \in I}X_i$ such that for all $i \in I$ the following diagram commutes

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[ ] %\arrow[bend right,swap]{dr}{F}
  Y \arrow[dotted,swap]{d}{\exists!\phi}\arrow[]{r}{f_i}& X_i\\
  \prod_{i \in I}X_i \arrow[]{ur}{\pi_i}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}


\begin{ex}[]
If $I$ is uncountable and the $X_i$ are non-trivial, then the product space does not satisfy the 1AA.
For this, we chose some non-trivial open subset $O_i \subseteq X_i$ for all $i \in I$ and some point $x_i \in O_i$.

If we assume that there exists a countable neighborhood basis $\mathcal{U}$ of $\{x_i\}_{i \in I}$, then we can assume that
\begin{align*}
  U \in U \implies U = \pi_{i_1}^{-1}(U_1) \cap \ldots \cap \pi_{i_n}^{-1}(U_n)
\end{align*}
But because $\mathcal{U}$ is countable, and each only has finitely many $\neq X_i$ factors and $I$ is uncountable,
there has to be an index $k \in I$ such that $\pi_k(U) = X_k$ for all $U \in \mathcal{U}$.

Which means that the neighborhood $\pi_k^{-1}(O_k) \subseteq \prod_{i \in I}X_i$ does not contain any $U \in U$, since
\begin{align*}
  (\pi_k \circ \pi_k^{-1})(O_k) = O_k \nsubseteq \pi_k(U) = X_k
\end{align*}

\end{ex}

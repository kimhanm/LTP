\begin{dfn}[]
  An Ordinary differential equation (\textbf{ODE}) is an equation that contains one or more derivatives of un an unknown function $x(t)$. The equation may contain $x$ itself and constants.
  We saythat and ODE \textbf{of order $n$} if $x^{(n)}(t)$ is the highest order derivative in the equation.

\section{Methods of resolution}
\subsection{Separation of variables}
Let $I,J$ be two open variables and $f \in C^0(I), g \in C^0(J)$. When doing separation of variables, we look for solutions to the equation
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d x}{d t} = f(t)g(x)
\end{align*}
with some initial conditions $t_0 \in I, x_0 = x(t_0) \in J$.
In the special case where $g(x_0) = 0$, then the constant function $x(t) = x_0$ is a solution to this equation.

Suppose that $g(x_0) \neq 0$ is non-zeo, then in a neighborhood of $x_0$, $g$ is non-zero so we can divide by $g(x)$ to separate the variables. We find
\begin{align*}
  \frac{dx}{g(x)} = f(t) dt
\end{align*}
If we let $F(t)$ and $G(x)$ be primites of $f(t)$ and $\frac{1}{g(x)}$, we get by integration that
\begin{align*}
  \int \frac{dx}{g(x)} = \int f(t) dt + c \implies x(t) = G^{-1}(F(t) + c)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Change of variables}
Consider the following homogeneous ODE:
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d x}{d t} = f \left(
    \frac{x(t)}{t}
  \right)
\end{align*}
, where $f: I \to \R$ is a continuous function on an open interval $I \subseteq \R$.
We change the variable to $x(t) = t y(t)$


Any ODE can be turned into an autonomous ODE.


We can see that from
\begin{align*}
  g'^T Jg' = J
\end{align*}
if we take the determinant on both sides, we see that $\det g'$ must be $\pm 1$, so $g'$ must be invertible.

Given a hamiltonian system
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d x}{d t} = J^{-1} \nabla H(x)
\end{align*}
a symplectic change of variables $y = g(x)$ preserves the hamiltonian sytem
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d y}{d t} = J^{-1} \nabla_y G(y)
\end{align*}

Consistent and Stable if and only if Convergent


Estimate



Taylor method: Use taylor expansion to generate next timestep
- $f$ must be smooth enough and we have to calculate alot.

Integration method: Approximate the integral between $t_k$ and $t_{k+1}$.
- Left endpoint rule: approximates integral by rectangle
- Trapezoidal rule requires knowledge of right endpoint. Is is implicit

Improved euler scheme: Use left endpoint rule to approximate $x^{(k+1)}$ then use the aproximation for trapezoid rule.

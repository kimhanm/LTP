\subsection{Sylow's Theorem}

\begin{dfn}[]
  For a finite group, $p$ prime and $p,m$ coprime, write
  $\abs{G} = p^{k} m$.
  A subgroup of order $p^{l}$ is called a \textbf{$p$-subgroup}.
\end{dfn}

\begin{thm}[Sylow's Theorem]
  Let $G$ be a finite group of order $\abs{G} = p^{k}m$ as above. 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item There exists a maximal $p$-subgroup $H_p$ of order $\abs{H_p} = p^{k}$. We call $H_p$ a \textbf{Sylow $p$-subgroup}.
    \item Every $p$-subgroup is contained in a Sylow $p$-subgroup.
    \item Any two Sylow $p$-subgroups are conjugates.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
Set $T = \{A \subseteq G \big\vert \abs{A} = p^{k}\}$.
Then $T$ is a $G$-set with left multiplication and $\abs{T} = \binom{n}{p^{k}} \neq 0 \mod p$.
With
\begin{align*}
  \abs{T} = \abs{\text{Fix}_G(T)} + \sum_{\text{non-trivial orbits}} [G: \text{Stab}_G(A)]
\end{align*}
Unless $p^{k} < \abs{G}$, then there are no fixpoints of the group action. 
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}[]
  Let $G$ be a group and $p$ prime with $p | \abs{G}$. THen there exists an elment $g \in G$ of order $\text{ord}(g) = p$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
Chose a Sylow $p$-subgroup $H_p$ and an element $g \in H_p \setminus \{e\}$
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[]
The group $A_n$ is simple for $n \geq 5$.
In particular, $A_n,S_n$ are resolvable if and only if $n \leq 4$.
\end{prop}
\begin{prop}[]
Groups of order $pq,p^{2}q,pqr$ for $p,q,r$ prime are resolvable.
\end{prop}

\begin{lem}[]
A non-trivial simple group has no subgroup of index $\leq 4$.

If it has a subgroup of index $5$, it is isomorphic to $A_5$.
\end{lem}


\begin{thm}[Classification theorem]
Let $G$ be a group of order $n = \abs{G} \leq 100$.
Then either $G$ is resolvable or $G \iso A_5$ (and $\abs{G} = 60$)
\end{thm}

\subsection{Time dilation}
Consider a clock which is at rest for an observer in reference frame $O$.
Between two clock ticks, the clock will have moved in the space-timeinterval 
\begin{align*}
  d \vec{x} = 0, \quad dt = \Delta t
\end{align*}
and its proper time interval is
\begin{align*}
  ds^{2} = (c^{2} dt^{2} - d \vec{x}^{2}) = c^{2} (\Delta t)^{2}
\end{align*}
A second observer sees the clock moving with velocity $\vec{v}$. Then two ticks of the clock will be separated by a space-time interval
\begin{align*}
  d \vec{\tilde{x}} = \vec{v} d \tilde{t}, \quad d \tilde{t} = \Delta \tilde{t}
\end{align*}
the proper-time interval in the new reference frame is then
\begin{align*}
  d \tilde{s}^{2} = c^{2} d \tilde{t}^{2} - d \vec{x}^{2} = c^{2} (\Delta \tilde{t})^{2} \left(
    1 - \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}
  \right)
\end{align*}
and since the proper time is the same in both reference frames, we get
\begin{empheq}[box=\bluebase]{align*}
  \Delta \tilde{t} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} = \gamma \Delta t
\end{empheq}


Now, imagine that the clock is a light source and pulses out light every tick

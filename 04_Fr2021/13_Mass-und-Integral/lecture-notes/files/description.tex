Lecture notes taken from the Measure and Integration lecture given by Dr. Francesca Da Lio during Spring Semester 2021 at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

With a focus on the theorems and their proofs,
these notes have fewer examples than given in the lecture, but the proofs will be more explicit.

The exam will be a 20 minute \textbf{oral exam}. It will consist of two or three questions where we have to prove some results.

The lecture slides and a script is provided at the professors home page \url{https://people.math.ethz.ch/~fdalio/MASSundINTEGRALFS21}.

The exam will be a 20 minute \textbf{oral exam}. It will consist of two or three questions where we have to prove some results.


\subsection*{Material}
The lecture slides and a script is provided at the professors \href{https://people.math.ethz.ch/~fdalio/MASSundINTEGRALFS21}{home page}.


If we naively try to define a notion of measure that has some intuitive properties, we can run into some problems that give paradoxical results.
The \textbf{Riemann Integral} we saw in Analysis I/II also had some drawbacks of not being general enough. 
We can use measure theory to define a better definition of the integral.

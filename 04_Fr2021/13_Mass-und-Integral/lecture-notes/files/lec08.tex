One would naturally think that the ``physical'' volume of an object should stay invariant under translation or rotation.
\begin{thm}[]
  The Lebegue measure is invariant under isometries $\Phi: \R^{n} \to \R^{n}, x \mapsto x_0 + Rx$, for $R \in O(n)$.
\end{thm}


\begin{dfn}[]
  A Borel measure $\mu$ on $\R^{n}$ is called \textbf{Borel regular}, if for every $A \subseteq \R^{n}$ there exists a borel set $B \supseteq A$ such that $\mu(A) = \mu(B)$.
\end{dfn}
The Lebesgue measure is Borel regular.
